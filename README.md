Cusomter Segmentation with Unsupervised Learning

This was a capstone project to complete the MIT Applied Data Science program, which is a 12-week intensive course covering many of the current data science
techniques and how they can be applied in a business setting

For my project, we received customer data that included profiles of the customers and their purchasing habits. The goal of the project was to segment the customers
based on their purchasing behavior and to understand who those customers are. 

I used dimensionality reduction techniques including PCA and t-SNE to better understand the most impactiful variables. Then I used 5 different clustering techniques to
determine which created the most helpful clusters. The techniques included K-means, K-medoids, Hierarchical clustering, DB-scan, and Gaussian Mean Modeling.

With the finished clusters, I made customer profiles for each cluster and provided buiness recommendations based on those clusters. 

This is my first complete Data science project and I plan to make many more, improving with each one.
